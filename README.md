nospy-pomodoro
==============

No-Spy Pomodoro Countdown is a bare-minimum implementation by design.

* it doesn't code obfuscation - so you know what's in there.
* it doesn't send your data anywhere - hallelujah
* it doesn't need to be beautiful - just functional.

You can understand what it does and change you want without
spending hours trying to figure out what new frontend trend
the developer wanted to try so he could achieve the same damn
result - like open source stuff should ideally be.

**Running it**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PauloMigAlmeida/nospy-pomodoro.git
cd nospy-pomodoro
npm install
npm run start
```

PS.: Don't forget to allow browser notifications when first running it ;-)

enjoy :-)
